## Work Experience
**Data Science Graduate Research Assistant @ Duke University School of Medicine (_May 2024 - Present_)**
- Developed a logistic regression model to predict how different demographic subgroups of patients respond to GLP-1 drugs, optimizing drug usage to more effectively target patients and assist physicians in making informed decisions
- Utilized PySpark to wrangle and clean US national electronic health record data from over 5.8 million patients and refined statistical methodologies, such as emulating randomized target trials, survival analysis, and matching algorithms, to establish a more accurate causal relationship

**Senior HR Data Analyst @ Shiseido (_September 2022 - November 2022_)**
- Developed classification, regression, and clustering algorithms to optimize workforce management strategies and reported the findings to the APAC headquarters and executives. The algorithms predict employee attrition, hiring needs, and labor cost fluctuations using e-HR system data, employee records, profiles, turnover rates, internal transfers, performance metrics, and market data

**Senior HR Data Analyst @ Wisebirds (_September 2020 - April 2022_)**
- Achieved a 60% reduction in work hours by implementing the Human Resources Information System, which automated essential HR workflows such as time and attendance, payroll, personnel records, and on/offboarding
- Increased employee satisfaction with training by 30% and boosted participation rates by 50% by launching a new personalized training and upskilling learning management system with recommendation engines

**HR Data Analyst @ Hanwha Q CELLS (_December 2015 - August 2020_)**
- Increased application rates by 50% and engagement and conversion rates by 30% through a data-driven overhaul of recruitment target marketing strategies, including A/B testing and optimizing web and mobile job application pages
- Saved 40% of HR manpower resources by building a recruitment chatbot for real-time candidate communication and creating a dashboard to track hiring success metrics, such as cost of hiring and time-to-fill

## Projects
### US Cardiovascular Mortality Prediction and Data Visualization

Used Ridge and GBM regression to predict future cardiovascular mortality rates for US states with an MSE of 0.1091 on a dataset of 170,000 rows and 30 features from 20 years of historical data, and developed a Streamlit web app and Tableau dashboard to visually present key public health indicators and highlight states needing improvement to reduce mortality rates

### African Roof Image Classification for Disaster Rescue in Zindi Machine Learning Competition

Achieved a top 5% ranking in a Machine Learning Competition for African roof image classification by using R-CNN, YOLO v3, and YOLO v8 models on an imbalanced dataset of 4,772 training and 2,045 test images, and improved model performance to a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.408 through strategic experimental designs, including image rebalancing and data augmentation

### Improved Yu-Gi-Oh Card Image Generation and Captioning via Archetype Segmentation

Implemented and fine-tuned image generation models (GAN, Stable Diffusion) and an image captioning model (GIT) using +10K Yu-Gi-Oh! card images, obtained via their API and web scraping text data. Improved evaluation metrics (FID and BLEU scores) by 6% and enhanced image quality through segmenting and isolating archetypes, while optimizing hyperparameters such as epochs and learning rates

### Fashion Industry Social Media Marketing Virality's Causal Effects on Customer Engagement

Analyzed one year of Instagram data from 20+ US fashion companies, using various time windows for viral posts, square-root and Z-score data transformations, and matched companies by follower count and post frequency

### YouTube Channel Revenue Forecasting and Earnings Prediction 			

Forecasted YouTube channel revenue and evaluated the probability of channels earning over $1 million annually by applying multiple linear and logistic regression models to 2023 global YouTube Channel data, and increased the R-squared score from 0.09 to 0.32 by identifying key revenue factors: views per subscriber, country, and number of uploads

### Development of Text-Based Song Recommendation Web Application using Azure Databricks

Developed a text-based mood-based song recommendation Streamlit web application using a data engineering pipeline (Azure Databricks) integrating Spotify and OpenAI GPT-3 API in a cloud-based environment, Azure App Services. Conducted load tests with 10,000 requests to monitor response time and ensure robust performance of the web microservice, even under heavy user load, to maintain stability

### Sentiment Analysis on Real E-commerce Customer Review Data on Amazon and eBay

Performed sentiment analysis using Multinomial Naive Bayes with TF-IDF and Bag-of-Words models, along with a Bidirectional LSTM model, on real online customer review data from Amazon and Ebay, totaling over 95,000 cases. Achieved over 96% accuracy on a synthetic test dataset after hyperparameter tuning and compared their contextual awareness in handling challenges.
