## Work Experience
**Data Science Graduate Research Assistant @ Duke University School of Medicine (_May 2024 - Present_)**
- Developed a logistic regression model to predict how different demographic subgroups of patients respond to GLP-1 drugs, optimizing drug usage to more effectively target patients and assist physicians in making informed decisions
- Utilized PySpark to wrangle and clean US national electronic health record data from over 5.8 million patients and refined statistical methodologies, such as emulating randomized target trials, survival analysis, and matching algorithms, to establish a more accurate causal relationship

**Senior HR Data Analyst @ Shiseido (_September 2022 - November 2022_)**
- Developed classification, regression, and clustering algorithms to optimize workforce management strategies and reported the findings to the APAC headquarters and executives. The algorithms predict employee attrition, hiring needs, and labor cost fluctuations using e-HR system data, employee records, profiles, turnover rates, internal transfers, performance metrics, and market data

**Senior HR Data Analyst @ Wisebirds (_September 2020 - April 2022_)**
- Achieved a 60% reduction in work hours by implementing the Human Resources Information System, which automated essential HR workflows such as time and attendance, payroll, personnel records, and on/offboarding
- Increased employee satisfaction with training by 30% and boosted participation rates by 50% by launching a new personalized training and upskilling learning management system with recommendation engines

**HR Data Analyst @ Hanwha Q CELLS (_December 2015 - August 2020_)**

## Projects
### US Cardiovascular Mortality Prediction and Data Visualization

Used Ridge and GBM regression to predict future cardiovascular mortality rates for US states with an MSE of 0.1091 on a dataset of 170,000 rows and 30 features from 20 years of historical data, and developed a Streamlit web app and Tableau dashboard to visually present key public health indicators and highlight states needing improvement to reduce mortality rates

### African Roof Image Classification for Disaster Rescue in Zindi Machine Learning Competition

Achieved a top 5% ranking in a Machine Learning Competition for African roof image classification by using R-CNN, YOLO v3, and YOLO v8 models on an imbalanced dataset of 4,772 training and 2,045 test images, and improved model performance to a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.408 through strategic experimental designs, including image rebalancing and data augmentation

### Fashion Industry Social Media Marketing Virality's Causal Effects on Customer Engagement

Analyzed one year of Instagram data from 20+ US fashion companies, using various time windows for viral posts, square-root and Z-score data transformations, and matched companies by follower count and post frequency
